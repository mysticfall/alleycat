# Alley Cat

**Alley Cat** is an experimental VR and AI game platform built for
the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot).

### ⚠️ Project Status: Early Experimental

This project is in a very early stage of development. It is currently intended for exploration and inspiration rather
than practical use in production projects.

### 📦 Asset Notice

Please note that this repository **does not include the assets** required to run the game.

While Alley Cat serves as the foundation for my own game development, I cannot release my private game data under an
open-source license at this time. I may provide a set of demo assets in the future; until then, this project serves
primarily as a reference for other developers.
