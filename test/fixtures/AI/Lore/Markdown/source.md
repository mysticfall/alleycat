# The World

The game is based on a fantasy world ruled by cats.

## Culture and Daily Life

Cats consider themselves refined beings surrounded by chaos.

### Social Etiquette

Proper behaviour includes:

- Ignoring others until food appears
- Making eye contact while pushing objects off tables
- Leaving rooms dramatically

### Art and Expression

Art is expressed through:

- Strategic scratching
- Performance screaming at dawn
- Minimalist floor vomit

### Recreation

Popular activities include napping, pre-napping, and recovering from naps.

## World Overview

The entire realm is optimised for feline comfort.  
Gravity is calibrated for knocking things over, and all flat surfaces are legally considered beds.

## Governance of the Cat Realm

Cats claim to have a highly structured government, though no written laws have survived being sat on.

### The High Council of Whiskers

The ruling body is composed of the fluffiest and most judgmental cats in the land.  
Meetings last exactly as long as everyone remains awake.

### Laws and Enforcement

Laws are enforced inconsistently but confidently.

Common crimes include:

- Touching the belly without permission
- Closing doors
- Existing while edible

### Succession of Power

Leadership is transferred when the current ruler finds a warmer spot and leaves.
